a string array A. containing all the N office desk numbers.

and retum an integer value representing how far he is from the nearest corner seat. 
Return O, if he is in the corner seat.

Note:

There will always be at least one gap in the string array A

Desk number is always in a format of a number first followed by an English letter in uppercase

Assume 0-based indexing
