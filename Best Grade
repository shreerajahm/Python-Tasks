Best Grade:
Andrew has a string N consisting of lowercase English letters representing respective
grades of N students in his class. His grade is at Pth index. He can swap any two adjacent grades.

Your task is to help Andrew find and return a string value, representing maximized grade
by bringing lexicographically smallest character on the Pth index after doing at most K swaps

Sample Input:
abcdefg
3
2

Sample Output:
a
