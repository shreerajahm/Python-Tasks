Signature for LCM:
Given two numbers a and b. Find the GCD and LCM of and d.

Input:
â€¢ Two positive Integers a and b (1 <=a, b <=1000)

Output:
For GCD function, an integer representing the GCD of a and b
For LCM function, an integer representing the LCM of a and b

Sample Input:
12 18

Output:
6
36
