Special string:
Alice has a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Her friend gives
her another string S and asks her to modify string A and replace its characters with the characters present in string S.

But, to achieve the above task, Alice must follow the below steps:
1. Choose a character from string S that has the minimum ASCII distance from the ith character in string A
Repilace the ith character in string A with the chosen character in string S

Your task is to find and return an integer value, representing minimum total ASCII distance
that is required to modify string A to the characters in string S. Return O, if all the 
characters in string S are already present in string A

sample input:
abcd
xyz

sample output:
86
